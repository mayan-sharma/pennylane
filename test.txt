Create a modern expense tracker web app using Vite, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.

Core features to implement first:
- Add/edit/delete expenses with date, amount, category, description
- Basic expense categorization (Food, Transport, Bills, Entertainment, etc.)
- Simple dashboard showing total expenses and recent transactions
- Basic expense list with search and filter by date/category
- Local storage for data persistence

Future features to implement later:
- Kotak Bank API integration for automatic transaction import
- Tax calculation (income tax, GST tracking, deductions)
- Receipt photo uploads with OCR
- Budgeting tools and spending limits
- Advanced reporting and analytics
- Data export/import (CSV/Excel)
- Multi-currency support
- Bill reminders and notifications

Focus on clean, responsive UI with good performance. Use modern React patterns with TypeScript for type
safety.
